# Dennis’s dotfiles [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/dnnsmnstrr/dotfiles.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/dnnsmnstrr/dotfiles)

> These are my dotfiles. There are many like them, but these are mine.

Since [dotfiles](https://dotfiles.github.io) are very personal, I would not recommend just installing mine. Take a look and get inspiration, but there are better places to start off from. (such as the repo this one is forked from)
I do recommend checking out my [preset](bettertouchtool/HydroTouch) for [BetterTouchTool](https://folivora.ai)! It is an extension to [AquaTouch](https://community.folivora.ai/c/setup-preset-sharing/aquatouch) by [@yuuiko](https://github.com/yuuiko), which I also highly recommend.
My BTT setup basically makes my computer unusable for anyone other than myself, which can certainly cause situations like this:

## Installation

**Warning:** If you want to give these dotfiles a try, you should first fork this repository :heavy_check_mark: , review the code, and remove things you don’t want or need. Don’t blindly use my settings unless you know what that entails. Use at your own risk!

### Using Git and the bootstrap script

You can clone the repository wherever you want. (I like to keep it in `~/.dotfiles`) The bootstrapper script will pull in the latest version and copy the files to your home folder.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dnnsmnstrr/dotfiles.git && cd .dotfiles/setup && source bootstrap.sh
```

To update, `cd` into your local `dotfiles/setup` folder and then:

```bash
source bootstrap.sh
```

Alternatively, to update while avoiding the confirmation prompt:

```bash
set -- -f; source bootstrap.sh
```

There are also the aliases `bootstrap` or `sd` (source dotfiles)

### Git-free install

To install these dotfiles without Git:

```bash
cd; curl -#L https://github.com/dnnsmnstrr/dotfiles/tarball/master | tar -xzv --strip-components 1 --exclude={README.md,bootstrap.sh,.osx,LICENSE-MIT.txt}
```

To update later on, just run that command again.

### Specify the `$PATH`

If `~/.path` exists, it will be sourced along with the other files, before any feature testing (such as [detecting which version of `ls` is being used](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles/blob/aff769fd75225d8f2e481185a71d5e05b76002dc/.aliases#L21-26)) takes place.

Here’s an example `~/.path` file that adds `/usr/local/bin` to the `$PATH`:

```bash
export PATH="/usr/local/bin:$PATH"
```

### Add custom commands without creating a new fork

If `~/.extra` exists, it will be sourced along with the other files. You can use this to add a few custom commands without the need to fork this entire repository, or to add commands you don’t want to commit to a public repository.

My `~/.extra` looks something like this:

```bash
# Git credentials
# Not in the repository, to prevent people from accidentally committing under my name
GIT_AUTHOR_NAME="Dennis Muensterer"
GIT_COMMITTER_NAME="$GIT_AUTHOR_NAME"
git config --global user.name "$GIT_AUTHOR_NAME"
GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL="dennismuensterer@gmail.com"
GIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL="$GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL"
git config --global user.email "$GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL"
```

You could also use `~/.extra` to override settings, functions and aliases from my dotfiles repository. It’s probably better to [fork the repository](https://github.com/dnnsmnstrr/dotfiles/fork) instead, though.

### Sensible macOS defaults

When setting up a new Mac, you may want to set some sensible macOS defaults:

```bash
./.macos
```

Definitely go through and check each setting before running, this can change some major things!

### Install Homebrew formulae

When setting up a new Mac, you may want to install some common [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) formulae (after installing Homebrew, of course):

```bash
./.dotfiles/setup/brew.sh
```

(aliases)

Some of the functionality of these dotfiles depends on formulae installed by `brew.sh`. If you don’t plan to run `brew.sh`, you should look carefully through the script and manually install any particularly important ones. A good example is Bash/Git completion: the dotfiles use a special version from Homebrew.
